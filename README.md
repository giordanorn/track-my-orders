# Track my orders
This set of scripts are useful for tracking any orders from Correios delivery service.

# Setup
Once you cloned this repository, to track your orders, you'll need to create a file called `orders` and then store your orders in it as follows:
```sh
# orders

# code        description or title (whatever you want actually)
PxxxxxxxxxxBR Laptop that I just bought hehe
...           ...
```
> *Do not* put these lines with '#' in your file, they are just illustratives in this example.

---

Also, you'll need to create a file called `mailto`, and put the email address you want to keep notifying after any change is detected in your orders.
